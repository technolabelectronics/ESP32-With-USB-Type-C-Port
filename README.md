 # INTRODUCTION
 We all love ESP32 microcontroller, In any of IOT Project we often use ESP32 module,ESP32 is one of the power-full and pretty famous microcontroller in the field  of IOT.
 ESP32 comes with lot of amazing and useful features, like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity  which enables  wide-range of applications. Even I have made lot of projects using this ESP32 module.

This ESP32 development module was launch in year 2016. Since then lots of things changes in technology but we are still using the same board.

For example the micro USB Port is replaced by the Type- C Port , Almost in every electronic devices.

And there are many countries and regions where they are moving to make USB Type-C as the compulsory common Port for all the electronics devices.
 

So I decided to design my version of ESP32 module, with USB Type-C port. Yes you heard right USB type-C port.

Type-C ports has lots of benefits  it is very convenient to use , and has greater speed than micro USB connectors,
This  makes Type-c port  a popular choice for modern devices.
And Nowdays almost everyone has USB Type-C cable...so USB cable is also no more worry.

So this brand new esp32 has usb type-c Port and also this esp32 board looks very beautiful.
I am selling this esp32 board if you want you can purchase from my website.
